## Conclusion

The NetForge testing suite has a strong foundation with comprehensive vendor coverage and well-structured test organization. However, critical infrastructure issues are preventing the realization of its full potential. The completion roadmap provides a clear path to achieve 95%+ test completion within 6 months.

The key to success will be addressing the critical Protocol Plugin Discovery and SSH Service issues in Phase 1, as these are foundational to all other testing efforts. Once these blockers are resolved, the extensive existing test infrastructure can be leveraged to rapidly improve overall test completion rates.

With dedicated resources and systematic execution of the roadmap phases, NetForge can achieve a production-ready testing suite that ensures high-quality, reliable network simulation capabilities across all supported vendors and scenarios.
