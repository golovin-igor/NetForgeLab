# NetForge Testing Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the NetForge network simulation framework. NetForge is a multi-vendor network device simulation platform with extensive CLI handlers, protocol implementations, and device-specific behaviors.

## Current Testing Landscape

### Test Project Structure
- **NetForge.Simulation.CliHandlers.Tests** - CLI command handler tests for all vendors
- **NetForge.Simulation.Tests** - Core simulation functionality tests  
- **NetForge.Simulation.Protocols.Tests** - Network protocol implementation tests

### Test Categories

#### 1. CLI Handler Tests
- **Vendor-Specific Commands**: Cisco, Arista, Juniper, Huawei, Nokia, Dell, Extreme, Aruba, Fortinet, MikroTik, F5, Broadcom, Alcatel, Linux
- **Common Commands**: Help, enable/disable, ping, hostname, reload
- **Command Coverage**: Configuration, operational, diagnostic commands
- **Mode Testing**: User mode, privileged mode, configuration modes

#### 2. Core Simulation Tests
- **Device Factory**: Device creation for different vendors
- **Network Configuration**: Interface configs, VLANs, routing
- **Protocol Configuration**: OSPF, BGP, EIGRP, RIP, STP
- **Event System**: Network event bus, state changes
- **Integration Tests**: Multi-device scenarios

#### 3. Protocol Tests
- **Protocol Discovery**: Plugin discovery mechanism
- **Protocol Services**: SSH, Telnet, SNMP, HTTP protocols
- **State Management**: Protocol initialization and lifecycle

## Current Test Status Assessment

### Test Execution Results
Based on recent test runs, there are significant issues across multiple test categories:

#### Critical Issues Identified
1. **Protocol Plugin Discovery Failures** - Core protocol loading mechanism broken
2. **SSH Protocol Service Failures** - Network service initialization issues  
3. **CLI Handler Inconsistencies** - Command responses don't match expected formats
4. **Vendor-Specific Prompt Issues** - Device prompts not matching expected formats
5. **Configuration Mode Handling** - Mode transitions not working correctly

#### Failing Test Patterns
- Enable/disable command handling across vendors
- Device prompt format inconsistencies (Nokia: "A:R1# " vs "R1#", Huawei: "<R1>" vs "R1#")
- Configuration command parsing and response generation
- Protocol service state management

## Testing Priorities

### Priority 1: Critical Infrastructure (Immediate)
- [ ] Fix protocol plugin discovery mechanism
- [ ] Repair SSH/Telnet protocol services
- [ ] Standardize device prompt handling across vendors
- [ ] Fix enable/disable command processing

### Priority 2: CLI Handler Stabilization (Next 2 weeks)
- [ ] Audit and fix vendor-specific command handlers
- [ ] Standardize command response formats
- [ ] Fix configuration mode transitions
- [ ] Improve command parsing reliability

### Priority 3: Protocol Integration (Next 4 weeks)
- [ ] Test protocol state synchronization
- [ ] Validate inter-device protocol communication
- [ ] Test protocol configuration persistence
- [ ] Verify protocol event handling

### Priority 4: Advanced Features (Ongoing)
- [ ] Multi-vendor interoperability testing
- [ ] Performance and stress testing
- [ ] Complex network topology testing
- [ ] Security and edge case testing

## Testing Approach

### 1. Unit Testing
- Individual command handlers tested in isolation
- Protocol services tested independently
- Device creation and configuration tested per vendor
- Mock dependencies for external systems

### 2. Integration Testing
- Multi-device network scenarios
- Protocol communication between devices
- End-to-end CLI sessions
- Configuration persistence across reboots

### 3. System Testing
- Complete network topologies
- Real-world simulation scenarios
- Performance benchmarking
- Stress testing with high device counts

### 4. Regression Testing
- Automated test suite execution
- Vendor-specific regression suites
- Protocol compatibility testing
- Performance regression monitoring

## Test Environment Requirements

### Development Environment
- .NET 9.0 SDK
- xUnit test framework
- Mock frameworks for external dependencies
- Test data generators for network configurations

### CI/CD Integration
- Automated test execution on code changes
- Test result reporting and analysis
- Coverage reporting
- Performance benchmarking

### Test Data Management
- Vendor-specific configuration templates
- Network topology definitions
- Protocol configuration samples
- Expected command output libraries

## Success Metrics

### Code Coverage
- Target: 85% code coverage across all projects
- CLI Handlers: 90% coverage
- Core Simulation: 85% coverage
- Protocols: 80% coverage

### Test Reliability
- Test pass rate: 95%+ in CI/CD
- Flaky test rate: <2%
- Test execution time: <10 minutes for full suite

### Bug Detection
- Critical bugs caught before production: 100%
- Regression detection rate: 95%
- Time to identify issues: <24 hours

## Test Maintenance Strategy

### Regular Activities
- Weekly test suite health checks
- Monthly test coverage analysis
- Quarterly test strategy review
- Vendor compatibility updates as needed

### Test Code Quality
- Test code reviews for all changes
- Test documentation maintenance
- Test data validation and updates
- Test environment consistency checks

## Risk Mitigation

### Known Risks
1. **Vendor CLI Complexity**: Different vendors have unique command structures
2. **Protocol Interdependencies**: Changes in one protocol affect others
3. **Configuration State Management**: Complex state transitions between modes
4. **Performance Impact**: Large test suites may slow development cycles

### Mitigation Strategies
- Modular test design for vendor isolation
- Protocol interface abstraction for testing
- State machine testing for mode transitions
- Parallel test execution and selective testing

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate** (Week 1):
   - Fix critical protocol plugin discovery issues
   - Address SSH protocol service failures
   - Standardize device prompt handling

2. **Short-term** (Weeks 2-4):
   - Systematic CLI handler bug fixes
   - Implement missing test coverage
   - Establish CI/CD testing pipeline

3. **Medium-term** (Months 2-3):
   - Complete protocol integration testing
   - Performance and scalability testing
   - Advanced multi-vendor scenarios

4. **Long-term** (Ongoing):
   - Continuous test suite maintenance
   - New feature test development
   - Test automation improvements
