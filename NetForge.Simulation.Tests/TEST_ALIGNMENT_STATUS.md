# NetForge Test Alignment Status

## Overview
This document tracks the alignment between NetForge's testing strategy and the current implementation, identifying gaps and inconsistencies that need to be addressed.

## Current Alignment Assessment

### Test Coverage Analysis

#### ✅ Well-Aligned Areas
- **CLI Handler Structure**: Comprehensive vendor-specific test organization
- **Device Factory Testing**: Good coverage of device creation patterns
- **Basic Command Testing**: Core commands like help, enable, disable have tests
- **Multi-Vendor Support**: Tests exist for all major network vendors

#### ⚠️ Partially Aligned Areas
- **Protocol Testing**: Tests exist but many are failing due to initialization issues
- **Configuration Testing**: Good test structure but execution failures indicate implementation gaps
- **Integration Testing**: Basic tests present but complex scenarios need work
- **Event System Testing**: Event handling tests exist but may not cover all edge cases

#### ❌ Misaligned Areas
- **Protocol Plugin Discovery**: Critical failures indicate fundamental architecture issues
- **Service Initialization**: SSH, Telnet, and other services failing to start properly
- **Device Prompt Standardization**: Tests expect consistent prompts but implementations vary
- **Command Response Formats**: Expected outputs don't match actual device responses

## Specific Alignment Issues

### 1. Protocol System Alignment

#### Issue: Protocol Plugin Discovery Failure
- **Expected**: Automatic discovery and loading of protocol plugins
- **Actual**: `ProtocolDiscovery_ShouldFindAllExpectedPlugins` test fails
- **Impact**: Core protocol system non-functional
- **Priority**: Critical - blocks all protocol functionality

#### Issue: SSH Protocol Service Startup
- **Expected**: SSH service should start when enabled on device
- **Actual**: `SshProtocol_WhenEnabled_ShouldStartServer` test fails
- **Impact**: SSH connectivity features non-functional
- **Priority**: High - affects device accessibility

### 2. CLI Handler Alignment

#### Issue: Device Prompt Inconsistencies
- **Nokia Devices**: Expected "R1#" but getting "A:R1# "
- **Huawei Devices**: Expected "R1#" but getting "<R1>"
- **Broadcom Devices**: Expected "SW1#" but getting "\nSW1#"
- **Impact**: CLI parsing and prompt recognition failures
- **Priority**: High - affects user experience

#### Issue: Enable Command Behavior
- **Expected**: Consistent enable command behavior across vendors
- **Actual**: Multiple vendors failing enable alias tests
- **Impact**: Privilege escalation not working properly
- **Priority**: High - affects device security model

### 3. Configuration System Alignment

#### Issue: VLAN Configuration Commands
- **Expected**: Standard VLAN configuration across vendors
- **Actual**: Various vendor-specific VLAN commands failing
- **Impact**: Network configuration features incomplete
- **Priority**: Medium - limits configuration capabilities

#### Issue: Interface Configuration
- **Expected**: Consistent interface configuration patterns
- **Actual**: Vendor-specific interface commands have different behaviors
- **Impact**: Interface management inconsistencies
- **Priority**: Medium - affects network setup

### 4. Integration Test Alignment

#### Issue: Multi-Device Scenarios
- **Expected**: Devices should interact properly in network topologies
- **Actual**: Limited testing of device-to-device communication
- **Impact**: Real-world simulation accuracy compromised
- **Priority**: Medium - affects simulation realism

#### Issue: Protocol Communication
- **Expected**: Protocols should communicate between devices
- **Actual**: No comprehensive inter-device protocol tests
- **Impact**: Protocol behavior in multi-device networks unknown
- **Priority**: Medium - affects network protocol simulation

## Alignment Gaps by Test Category

### Unit Test Gaps
1. **Protocol Service Unit Tests**: Missing comprehensive protocol service testing
2. **Command Parser Tests**: Limited testing of command parsing edge cases
3. **State Management Tests**: Insufficient testing of device state transitions
4. **Error Handling Tests**: Limited testing of error conditions and recovery

### Integration Test Gaps
1. **Cross-Vendor Communication**: No tests for different vendor devices communicating
2. **Protocol Interoperability**: Missing tests for protocol compatibility
3. **Network Topology Tests**: Limited complex topology testing
4. **Performance Integration**: No performance testing in integrated scenarios

### System Test Gaps
1. **End-to-End Scenarios**: Limited complete workflow testing
2. **Scale Testing**: No testing with large numbers of devices
3. **Stress Testing**: Missing high-load scenario testing
4. **Recovery Testing**: Limited testing of system recovery scenarios
